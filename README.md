Axon Cars Sales Power BI Project

The Axon Cars Sales Power BI Project is a comprehensive analysis of sales data from Axon Cars, a fictional automobile dealership. Leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, this project dives deep into sales metrics, customer demographics, product performance, and regional trends to provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making. Through intuitive visualization and interactive dashboards, stakeholders can explore key metrics such as sales performance over time, top-selling car models, customer segmentation, and geographic distribution of sales. By uncovering patterns and trends within the data, this project aims to empower the Axon Cars team with the knowledge needed to optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
